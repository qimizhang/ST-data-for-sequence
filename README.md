Large ST processed data for sequence prediction tasks
# LargeST dataset for sequence
## Note: 
 The dataset concludes the 2019, 2020, and 2021 traffic flow data of freeways in LA.
 We currently set the data for the specific day 12.24, time slot in 8:00-11:00 a.m. as input data, which has 12 flows in length. The next one-hour data is considered as labels in prediction tasks. 

 You could train the sequence prediction task using the processed data. Input data and labels for three years are listed in CSV files.

 These settings could be changed as requirements. Please check the code and origin data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10Do1bC_5oHe3x_fyieXTXTD190y8cp-4?usp=sharing.
